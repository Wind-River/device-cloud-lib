These remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies available to Wind River. In the event Wind River elects to terminate this Agreement or to cease providing the Services, Wind River will make commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available solely for the purpose of allowing you to recover any Customer Content for a period of not less than ten (10) days after notice to you.

8. PAYMENT TERMS; TAXES.

8.1. Payment Terms. You will pay Wind River the fees set forth in the applicable Order Document.  Wind River will invoice you upon confirmation and acceptance of a purchase order.  Payment terms herein are subject to prior credit approval by Wind River.  You will pay all invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice, in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise set forth in an Order Document.  Interest on late payments will accrue at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or partial month, or, if lower, the highest rate permitted by law.  You are responsible for reasonable costs associated with collection of overdue amounts, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs.  Failure to pay any invoice in the manner described in this Section may, at Wind River’s discretion, be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.  All Fees paid are non-refundable, non-creditable and not subject to set-off.

8.2. Taxes. All amounts due hereunder will be paid without deduction, set-off or counter claim, free and clear of any restrictions or conditions, and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, deductions, withholdings or other governmental charges.  If any deduction is required to be made by law, you will pay the full license or other fee owed to Wind River plus the amount to be deducted, so that Wind River will receive the same amount as it would have received had the deduction not been required.  If you are claiming sales or use tax exemption, a valid and fully executed Tax Exempt Certificate must be attached to the purchase order.  You will promptly pay or reimburse all taxes (exclusive of taxes on Wind River’s net income), duties and assessments arising from amounts payable to Wind River under this Agreement, or furnish Wind River with evidence acceptable to the taxing authority to sustain exemption therefrom. For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable interest rate will be the applicable interest rate for each jurisdiction's respective rate for indirect tax underpayments.

9. ACCOUNT ACCESS, USERNAME AND PASSWORD. To access and use the Services, you must create an account associated with a valid e-mail address for each authorized user. Only one account may be created for any e-mail address. You are responsible for all activities within or from your account. Wind River, its suppliers, and licensors are not responsible for unauthorized access to any of your accounts. Wind River agrees to provide to you a username and password that permit you to access and use the access keys for the Services, provided that you provide any information required to issue such username and password. All usernames and passwords issued by Wind River are Confidential Information of Wind River. You agree to use your best efforts to protect your user names, passwords and other access to the Services from unauthorized access, reproduction, disclosure or use. In the event that you become aware of any such unauthorized access, reproduction, disclosure or use, you agree to notify Wind River immediately and fully cooperate, at Wind River’s direction and at your expense, to minimize the effects of such unauthorized access, reproduction, disclosure or use.

10. AUDIT. You must maintain accurate written records relating to your use of the Services and Agent Software, including records of Assets using the Agent Software. Wind River, its suppliers, and licensors may, upon reasonable notice and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with your normal business activities, audit your use and supporting records to confirm compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including any applicable third party terms and conditions.

WIND RIVER, ITS SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY WIND RIVER, ITS DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES WILL IN ANY WAY MODIFY THIS DISCLAIMER OR CREATE ANY WARRANTY. Without limitation, Wind River, its suppliers, and licensors (i) make no warranty with respect to the Services and Agent Software or to any malfunctions or other errors in hardware or software products caused by virus, infection, worm, or similar malicious code, (ii) make no warranty that the Services or any hardware or software products will protect against all possible security threats, including intentional misconduct by third parties, and (iii) are not liable for any downtime or service interruption, for any lost or stolen data or systems, or for any other damages arising out of or relating to any such actions or intrusions.

12. CUSTOMER CONTENT. You are solely responsible for the creation, content, operation, maintenance, security, backup, use of and claims relating to any Customer Content and for any software and systems you employ when accessing or using the Services. You agree to implement security measures that are commercially reasonable for your access and use of the Services and to protect the Services from unauthorized access, reproduction, disclosure or use. You acknowledge that the Services will be deployed from servers and other platforms located in the United States and elsewhere and warrant that you are authorized to provide the Customer Content to Wind River in connection with the Services. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Wind River from any third party claims, losses and liability either arising out of or in connection to the Customer Content or any breach of this Agreement. Wind River may monitor, obtain and use data relating to your access to and use of the Services and any Customer Content, including, without limitation, data in anonymized form.

13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. WIND RIVER, ITS SUPPLIERS AND ITS LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE OR GOODWILL, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, OR LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT, EXAMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, EVEN IF WIND RIVER HAS BEEN ADVISED OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL WIND RIVER’S AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID TO WIND RIVER BY YOU FOR THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE OR SERVICES UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER FORM IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages so this limitation and exclusion may not apply to you.

THE LIMITED WARRANTY, LIMITED REMEDIES, WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN WIND RIVER AND YOU.  WIND RIVER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY OPEN SOURCE MATERIALS) WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.

This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of the United States of America and the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws principles, and is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or of the Federal courts therein, provided, however, that Wind River will be entitled to seek injunctive relief in any appropriate forum. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of the designated courts and waive all objections to the designated jurisdiction and venue for those disputes. You agree that your breach of this Agreement may cause Wind River irreparable harm for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Wind River will therefore be entitled to obtain timely injunctive relief to protect Wind River’s rights in addition to any and all remedies available at law. If you reside outside of the United States, you may have other legal rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement.

16.2. Government End Users.

Any software provided to the U.S. Government or to U.S. Government end users only pursuant to an end user license agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

16.6. Miscellaneous. This Agreement does not create any agency, employment relationship, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between you and Wind River. Failure to require your performance of any obligation under this Agreement will not preclude Wind River from requiring performance in the future. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements by you and Wind River with respect to the Services. The terms and conditions of any purchase order or other instrument issued by you in connection with this Agreement will be of no force or effect. If a provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or invalid, the provision will be revised so as to best accomplish the objectives you and Wind River.
